# Introduction
# This is Diptanshu Kumar, working as Java/Javascript developer at Comcast. I work in Activation & Onboarding team which manages activation app for different products and other onboarding features like wifi picker app, remote pairing app, language selection app etc.Besides work, I spent time with frineds playing soccer or cricket.

What I want to get out of this couse is to how to better design or architect teh apps that I manage. Mostly these are front end apps, so whatever I learn in this course, I am planning to implement in my day to day work to make those apps more attractive, user friendly and robust as well.
